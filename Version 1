#This Program is for Julie to keep track of which items are being used and by who
#Created by Caden Govender

#Import tkinter so we can make a GUI
from tkinter import *

#Create the buttons and labels

    #All the labels, buttons and entry boxes
    Label(main_window, text="Customer Full Name") .grid(column=0, row=0)
    Label(main_window, text="Receipt Number") .grid(column=0, row=1)
    Label(main_window, text="Items Hired") .grid(column=0, row=2)
    Label(main_window, text="Number of Items Hired") .grid(column=0, row=3)
    Label(main_window, text="Row #") .grid(column=0, row=5, pady=20)
    Label(main_window, text="               ") .grid(column=2, row=0)
